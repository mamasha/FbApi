The major cause of spaghetti code, IMHO, not the lack of technical skills of a programmer, but wrong decomposition of a problem domain into properly decoupled concerns which then may become lego blocks to form any solution within that problem domain.

Programming to interface has implementation benefits on its own. But its real glory is expressing the building blocks of a problem domain in a short and concise way. With interfaces it is a matter of seconds to see if a class represents a decoupled concern and stands for the SOLID principles.
